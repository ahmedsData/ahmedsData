### My Background ### 
My names Ahmed Hassan. I'm about to graduate witha Bachelors in Data Science from Iowa State University.

I originally started my College career studying Mechanical Engineering, due to my love in the Automotive Industry.
I grew up (and still do) buying and selling cars with my father. 
I was fortunate enough to gain a Digital Engineering CO-OP with Toyota, and a Chassis Engineering Internship with Nissan. 

From these experiences I was able to learn that my passions utilizing Tech and software tools in order help make data-driven decision making/

I recieved my first full-time job in the Tech INdustry with Microsoft August of 2020 as a DataCenter Technician. 
There I learned how to troubleshoot hardware and software components of the physical parts that power the internet around the world.
I learned how to replace Motherboards, Hard Drives, SSDs, CPUs, PSUs, PDUs, and even setup and install a whole server rack!

On March of 2021, I was selected for a Career Experience as a Data Science Program Manager for the Edge Servers team. 
There oversaw technician Data from across the world, and used SQL and Kusto Queries to create PowerBI Dashboard that helped Captured Key Performance Metrics for the team I working with.
